# gtfs

This is a Go library for parsing GTFS static and realtime feeds.

The static parser is pretty straightforward and simply maps fields in the 
    GTFS static CSV files to associated Go types.

For realtime parsing the library offers two options.
Option one is to use the parser and types generated by the protobuf compiler with are available in the `proto` subpackage.
This saves you from having to compile the protobufs yourself.

Option two is to use the package's custom parser, which takes the protobuf output from option one,
  does a bunch of post-processing, and then outputs the result in standard (non-proto) Go types.
This post-processing does useful things like:

- Converts some data fields to more idiomatic Go types - for example, times are converted from `int64` Unix timestamps to `time.Time` values.

- Makes the representation of trips and vehicles more explicit - see details below.

- Implements business logic to map data in various GTFS realtime extensions to regular GTFS realtime fields.

`gtfs-rt-pb`

## Examples

Parse the GTFS static feed for the New York City Subway:

```go

```

Parse the GTFS realtime feed for the San Francisco Bay Area BART:

```go

```

Parse the GTFS realtime feed for the New York City Subway's G train:

```go

```

## Command line tool

## Static parser

## Realtime parser

What the realtime parser adds:

- Restuctures the proto message to
  - have the concept of Trip and Vehicle
  - make more explicit the link between these
  - create implicit trips and vehicles
- Converts to native Go types like Time and Duration
- Handles extensions (currently just the NYCT)
